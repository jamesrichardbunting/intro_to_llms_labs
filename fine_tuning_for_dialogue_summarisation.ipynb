    "In this notebook, you will fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization. You will use the [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text out of the box. To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Then you will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics."
